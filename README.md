#🌮 T.A.C.O. — Tag Auto-Combo Optimizer
T.A.C.O. is a strategic SEO injection tool for Next Space Rebels.

In the world of StarTube, your rocket's performance is only half the battle. The other half is gaming the algorithm. T.A.C.O. ensures you never leave a single subscriber on the table by mathematically calculating and automatically selecting the best possible tag combinations for every video you upload.

#🚀 Features
Algorithmic Optimization: Scans all tags generated by your flight (Style manager) and runs a combinatorial analysis to find the highest-yielding setup.

Context-Aware: Respects your current Player Rank and available Tag Slots (1 to 5).

Anti-Penalty Logic: Automatically accounts for "Audience Disinterest" by checking how recently you've used specific tags.

Seamless Integration: Hooks directly into the UIVideoMaker interface. Tags are selected with native sounds and visual updates the moment the screen opens.

#🛠️ How it Works
T.A.C.O. doesn't guess. It uses the game's own internal logic against itself:

Extraction: It pulls the current TagInstance pool from GameStateLaunch.style.tagsCurrent.

Simulation: It performs a brute-force evaluation of all unique combinations using the native GameStateLaunch.CalculateSubs method.

Injection: It invokes UIVideoMaker.SelectTag() programmatically to sync the UI, backend state, and audio feedback.
